# Outdoor-Feature-Tracking
This is the outdoor feature tracking module in paper "Model Predictive Control with Residual Learning and Real-time Disturbance Rejection: Design and Experimentation"

We provide a sample test output, and you can conduct tests based on your own video files.

## üöÄ Quick Start

#### 1.Modify the video path in objectTracking_withAngle_withKCF.py:

`cap = cv2.VideoCapture("path/to/your/video.mp4")  # Replace "path/to/your/video.mp4" with your video file path`

#### 2.Run the Python script and follow the prompts to input the required information:

>
> 2.1‚Äã‚Äã Enter the X-coordinate (in world coordinates) of the center point of the top-left label (press Enter to confirm).
>
> 2.2‚Äã‚Äã Enter the Y-coordinate (in world coordinates) of the center point of the top-left label (press Enter to confirm).
>
> 2.3‚Äã‚Äã Enter the distance(m) between the center points of the top-left and top-right labels (press Enter to confirm).
>
> 2.4‚Äã‚Äã Enter the number of labels used for relative positioning on the ground (press Enter to confirm).
>

#### 3.Use the pop-up window to annotate the label areas and target area (press Enter to confirm each selection).

‚ö†Ô∏è ‚Äã‚ÄãNote‚Äã‚Äã: When annotating labels, please follow the order:

        0: left-top
        1: right-top
        2: right-bottom
        3: left-bottom

This order is necessary for subsequent field-of-view angle correction and relative position calculation.

#### The target's pose information is published via ROS topics by default. You can subscribe to or record these topics for further use.
